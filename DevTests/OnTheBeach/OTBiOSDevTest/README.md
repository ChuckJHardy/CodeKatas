### OnTheBeach iOS Developer Test

##### Overview
Create a todo list iPhone application. A todo list is made up of many items. An item consists of a title, a description and the date the item was created.

The app should be able to perform the following functions:

- Add item
- Edit item
- Remove item

The list should persist when the app closes.

The app should save the todo list to a remote server. We do not expect you to write your own web services but instead make use of freely available ones.

We aren't interested in style or appearance of the app, just that functions. We’re interested to see how you structure your code, your command of the language and good design and testing principles, bear this in mind throughout.

**Hint**: Brownie points will be given for showing us your working (notes, commit history, some kind of idea how you approached the problem).

**Hint**: We’re pretty keen on tested code.
